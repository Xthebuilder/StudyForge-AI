StudyForge AI is highly configurable for different environments and use cases:

### **Basic Configuration**
```python
# Default settings work great for most users
python src/main.py
```

### **Advanced Configuration**
```python
from src.enterprise_timeout_config import EnterpriseTimeoutConfig

# Create custom configuration
config = EnterpriseTimeoutConfig(
    environment="development",  # or "staging", "production"
    debug_timeouts=True
)

# Customize timeouts
config.network.total_request_timeout = 1200  # 20 minutes
config.ai_model.inference_timeout = 900      # 15 minutes
```

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
export STUDYFORGE_ENVIRONMENT=production
export STUDYFORGE_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
export STUDYFORGE_TIMEOUT=600
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

We maintain a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability:

```bash
# Run full test suite
python tests/timeout_functionality_test.py
